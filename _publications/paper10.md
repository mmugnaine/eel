Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms and can spread through different ways. Mathematical models and computational simulation have been used extensively to investigate the transmission and spread of infectious diseases. In other words, mathematical model simulation can be used to analyse the dynamics of infectious diseases, aiming to understand the effects and how to control the spread. In general, these models are based on compartments, where each compartment contains individuals with the same characteristics, such as susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered. In this paper, we cast further light on some classical epidemic models, reporting possible outcomes from numerical simulation. Furthermore, we provide routines in a repository for simulations.
