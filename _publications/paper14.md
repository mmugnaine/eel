We propose a one-dimensional dynamical system, the sine-circle nontwist map, that can be considered a local approximation of the standard nontwist map and an extension of the paradigmatic sine-circle map. The map depends on three parameters, exhibiting a simple mathematical form but with a rich dynamical behavior. We identify periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic solutions for different parameter sets with the Lyapunov exponent and Slaterâ€™s theorem. From the bifurcation analysis, we determine two bifurcation lines, those that depend on just two of the control parameters, for which the bifurcation that occurs is of the saddle-node type. In order to investigate multistability, we analyze the bifurcation diagrams in the two directions of parameter variation and we observe some regions of hysteresis, representing the coexistence of different attractors. We also analyze different multistable scenarios, as single attractor, coexistence of periodic attractors, coexistence of chaotic and periodic attractors, chaotic behavior, and coexistence of different chaotic bands, by the Lyapunov exponent and the analysis of the domain occupied by the solutions. From the parameter spaces constructed, we observe the prevalence of single attractor and only chaotic behavior scenarios. The multistable scenario is, mostly, formed by different periodic attractors. Lastly, we analyze the crisis in chaotic attractors and we identify the interior and the boundary crisis. From our results, the boundary crisis plays a key role for the extinction of multistability.
