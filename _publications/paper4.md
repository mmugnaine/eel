We deal with stochastic network simulations in a model with three distinct species that compete under cyclic rules which are similar to the rules of the popular rock-paper-scissors game. We investigate the Hamming distance density and then the basin entropy behavior, running the simulations for some typical values of the parameters mobility, predation and reproduction and for very long time evolutions. The results show that the basin entropy is another interesting tool of current interest to investigate chaotic features of the network simulations that are usually considered to describe aspects of biodiversity in the cyclic three-species model.
